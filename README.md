# Seshat: Self-Learning AI Academic Assistant

A complete full-stack web application designed for students, teachers, and administrators to track study activities, monitor syllabus completion, take practice quizzes, analyze learning behavior, predict academic performance using Machine Learning, and receive personalized, rule-based study recommendations.

This project is built specifically as an **MCA (Master of Computer Applications) Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning academic project**, focusing on clean modularity, simple deployment, and comprehensive viva preparation features.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Secure user sign-up/login with specific dashboards for **Students**, **Teachers**, and **Administrators** (using JWT and BCrypt).
*   **Curriculum & Syllabus Builder**: Allows teachers to create/update subjects, units, and topics. Students can check off topics as they complete them to track their syllabus progress.
*   **Study Tracker & Analytics**: A logging tool for study sessions that generates weekly consistency charts, daily/weekly stats, and calculates learning streak metrics.
*   **Interactive MCQ Quiz Engine**: Pre-built mock exams with randomized multiple-choice questions, live timer, and score submission features.
*   **AI Study Advisor (Recommendation Engine)**: A rule-based engine that evaluates student activity (quiz performance, syllabus completion, inactivity) and writes actionable recommendations to the database.
*   **Performance Predictor (Scikit-Learn ML)**: A trained **Random Forest Regressor** model running on the backend that reads the student's study logs and quiz grades to predict their final exam percentage and letter grade.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.8+
*   Node.js 16+
*   *(Optional)* MySQL Server

### 1. Backend Setup
1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    *   **Windows**:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **macOS/Linux**:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  *(Optional)* By default, the app runs on **SQLite** (`database.db` will be auto-created). If you wish to switch to **MySQL**, open `config.py` and modify the credentials block:
    ```python
    # Set to True to use MySQL, False to fall back to SQLite
    USE_MYSQL = False 
    ```
5.  Start the Flask backend server:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The backend runs at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 2. Machine Learning Model Training (Optional)
The pre-trained model `ml/model.pkl` is already packaged in the project. If you wish to re-generate the dataset and re-train the model:
1.  Navigate to the `ml` folder.
2.  Run data generation:
    ```bash
    python generate_data.py
    ```
3.  Run model training:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

### 3. Frontend Setup
1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server
To expose the **Seshat** academic database and ML prediction models to external AI clients (like Cursor, Claude, or Gemini) using standard JSON-RPC over stdio:
1.  Verify the backend virtual environment is active.
2.  Start the MCP server:
    ```bash
    python mcp/mcp_server.py
    ```
3.  Add the server config to your AI desktop client settings. For example, in Cursor, add a new MCP server with Command: `python C:\path\to\Seshat\mcp\mcp_server.py` and Type: `stdio`.

## 🔒 Security, MCP, & Google Integrations

*   **AES-256 Symmetric Encryption**: Student study log notes are encrypted before writing to the database using Fernet keys derived from the Flask application `SECRET_KEY`, and transparently decrypted on API retrieval.
*   **1-Year Data Retention Purger**: Executes a startup retention query inside `app.py` that auto-deletes records (StudyLogs, QuizAttempts, Predictions) older than 365 days.
*   **Google OAuth 2.0 & Analytics**: Features a Google Sign-In button on the Login page and a mock Google verify route in the backend that auto-provisions a Student account. Google Analytics tracking (gtag.js) is also pre-configured.
*   **Remote Debugging**: Detailed instructions for Chrome DevTools debugging, CLI flags, and performance profiling are located in [browser_config.md](file:///C:/Users/MSI/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/academic_assistant/documentation/browser_config.md).

---

## 🧪 Verification & Automated Tests

To ensure the backend APIs function correctly, a comprehensive suite of unit tests has been written. To run the automated tests:
1.  Navigate to the `backend` folder and activate the virtual environment.
2.  Execute the following command:
    ```bash
    python -m unittest discover -p "test_*.py"
    ```
    This will run all test suites (Authentication, Subject Builder, Study Logging, Quizzes, Analytics, recommendations, and ML Predictions) and report validation results.

## 👥 Default Accounts for Testing

During viva/demonstrations, you can register new accounts using the UI, or use default roles. For testing, registration adapts automatically to the selected role:
*   **Student**: Requires `Institution`, `Course`, and `Semester`.
*   **Teacher**: Requires `Department`.
*   **Admin**: Standard registration fields.
